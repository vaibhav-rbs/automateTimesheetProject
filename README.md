automateTimesheetProject
========================
This project aims to automate the manual process of timesheet process.

Present the process is:
1. Accounts person sends user timesheet reminder generally on friday.
2. user needs to enter the hours and date manually.
3. user prints the timesheet, manually signs it.
4. user sends the signed timesheet to approving authority.
5. i.  approving authority approves and sign timesheet back to user.
   ii. approving authority does not approves and timesheet is sent back to user for rework.
6. i.  user sends manually approved timesheet to accounts person.
   ii. user does everthing again from step 2.
Now I aim to eliminate the manual process for signing/approving of docs.
